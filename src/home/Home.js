                        Growing up with brothers, we filmed many home videos 
                        and I grew to love videography. As I obtained more equipment 
                        and honed my craft, I offered to film my brother's wedding In the 
                        summer of 2016. After that experience, I knew what my business 
                        would be all about; working hard to preserve your memory the 
                        way you want to remember it, and Eastside Wedding Videography 
                        was born. You will love our films, commitment to quality is 
                        the cornerstone of our work. Give us a call! 
                        We would love to hear from you.
